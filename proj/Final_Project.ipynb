You are also free build on publically available models and code, but your report must clearly give attribution for the work of others and must clearly delineate your contributions. "

    "The project description should include the title of the project, participants, a description of the objectives of the project, and a plan for how the project will be completed. The description of the objectives should include modest predictions of the success of the project. The plan for completion should include a description of the training data and how it will be obtained, a discussion of what deep learning framework will be used and why, and a rough description of the planned network architecture.\n",

    "You are permitted to work together on a project in groups of two or three, but group size must not exceed three participants.  For group projects there must be a clearly delineated division of labor: you should state in the project description and project report who was responsible for which portion of the project. Each student must hand in a separate report. (Students will not necessarily get the same grade for the same project.)\n",

    "You should mention whether you are simply re-implementing what others have done before but applying to new data or whether you are attempting to do something new to the best of your knowledge. Creative and original projects will be judged more kindly than those that are rehashing something in the existing literature. And projects that include a component in which data is acquired/curated into training and validation sets will be veiwed more favorably than those that simply download an existing data set such as CIFAR-100.\n",

    "As this is a computer vision course it is expected that your data will be visual, but excpetions might be made if the student is enthusiatic and persuasive enough. The most straightforward project would be to build a system that classifies images into catogories. A more difficult project might be to build a system that detects and localizes a type of object within an image. A still more complicated project might involve joining a ConvNet with an LSTM for a problem (like image captioning) that requires vision and language. But again, creative and originnal projects will be judged more kindly.  \n",
